# Copilot Instructions for cashout-tracker

## Project Overview
This project appears to be a Python-based application. The workspace currently contains only a `venv` directory, indicating that the codebase may be in an early stage or files are not yet present. As the project evolves, update this document to reflect new architectural decisions, workflows, and conventions.

## Environment Setup
- The Python virtual environment is located in `venv/`. Always activate this environment before installing dependencies or running scripts.
- Use `Scripts\activate` (Windows) to activate the environment.

## Directory Structure
- `venv/`: Python virtual environment. Do not place source code or configuration files here.
- Source code, configuration, and documentation should be placed at the project root or in dedicated folders (e.g., `src/`, `docs/`, etc.) as the project grows.

## Developer Workflows
- **Dependency Management:** Install packages using pip after activating the virtual environment.
- **Testing, Building, and Debugging:** No test, build, or debug scripts are present yet. Add instructions here as these workflows are established.

## Conventions & Patterns
- Follow standard Python project structure and naming conventions until project-specific patterns emerge.
- Update this file to document any unique architectural decisions, service boundaries, or data flow patterns as they are implemented.

## Integration Points
- No external integrations or dependencies are currently defined. Document any APIs, services, or cross-component communication as they are added.

## How to Update This Document
- When new files, directories, or workflows are added, update this document to help AI agents and developers onboard quickly.
- Reference key files and directories that exemplify important patterns.

**Example Update Section:**
> If you add a `src/` directory with a main application module, describe its purpose and how it interacts with other components. If you introduce a custom build or test workflow, provide the exact commands and any required environment variables.
